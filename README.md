Having troubles compiling the project?
Try opening the PhysioGuide_7.xcworkspace file instead of the Physioguide_7.xcodeproj

To login, pick either ‘scott’ or ‘thomas’ or ‘arlene’ or ‘rohm’ and input it into the username and password. We have a database set up but have some issues integrating it into the applications,  and will be fully functional for version 3.
